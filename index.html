        <h2>About the Issue</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Access to clean drinking water is a basic human right, yet many Indigenous communities in Canada face ongoing water advisories and lack access to safe water. This issue has deep historical roots and continues to affect thousands of people today.</p>
            <p>Statistics show that over 30% of Indigenous communities in Canada have experienced water advisories. This situation has severe impacts on health, well-being, and quality of life.</p>

It also creates social and economic challenges, hindering education, economic development, and overall community well-being.</p>
